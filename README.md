## Features
- Responsive Dashboard: Adaptive design for a seamless experience across devices.- Dark Mode: Theme switcher that toggles between light and dark themes.- Dynamic Styling: Uses styled-components for modular and maintainable styles.- Performance-Optimized: Built with Vite, ensuring faster development builds and optimized bundling.
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 14 or above) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarn.com/)
## Setup and Run Locally
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GDheerajRedd/Juspay-UI-Assignment.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo-name`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` Or if you're using yarn, `yarn`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
## Design Decisions
- React with styled-components: Using styled-components allowed for modular, reusable, and scoped styles, reducing CSS conflicts and improving maintainability. This also enabled easy implementation of dynamic styling, such as theme switching.
- Vite for web bundling: Vite was chosen for its superior performance in development and optimized builds compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack. The hot module replacement (HMR) made the development process seamless and efficient.
- Dark Mode Implementation: The theme switcher dynamically toggles between light and dark themes, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
- Netlify Deployment: Netlify's simplicity and free hosting tiers made it an ideal choice for deploying the application quickly and efficiently.

## Challenges Faced
1. Dynamic Styling: Implementing smooth transitions for theme switching required carefully handling props and ensuring consistent behavior across all components.
2. Component Structure: Structuring the application components for scalability while maintaining readability posed initial challenges. Adopting a modular component approach solved this issue.
3. Vite Integration: Adjusting to the Vite ecosystem, including its plugin system and configuration, was initially unfamiliar but ultimately rewarding due to its performance benefits.
## Technologies Used
1. React: Component-based library for building user interfaces.
2. styled-components: For creating reusable and dynamic styled components.
3. Vite: Fast bundler and development server.
4. Netlify: For hosting the application.
